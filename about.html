    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is Nicolò Meneghetti and welcome to my personal page.
        I live in Pisa where I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Biorobotics Institute of Sant'anna School of Advanced Studies. I work within the Computational Neuralengineering Lab, masterfully supervised by Dr. Alberto Mazzoni.
        Before I began my Ph.D. in October 2019, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering in Genoa in 2016. Then I moved in Pisa, where I got my Master’s degree in Bionics Engineering, jointly delivered by University of Pisa and Sant'anna School of Advanced Studies.

    <p>
        I have had the luxury of having the opportunity to work with an extremely dynamic lab and with an enthusiastic and passionate supervisor. This has given me the opportunity of facing very different research questions and themes, despite being an early (very early) researcher. 
        <br>My Bachelor’s thesis consisted in the implementation of
        <br>During my first year of Mater’s I had for example the opportunity to work with calcium imaging of dissected hippocampal and cortical slices at the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste with Professor Vincent Torre.
        <br>During my Master’s thesis I investigated the neural correlates of low intensity ultrasonic stimulation (US). I investigated the effect of US on leech ganglion cells recorded with intracellular electrodes and on larval stage of zebrafishes recorded with wide field calcium imaging.
        As a PhD student I am instead currently investigating the mechanisms behind the rythmogenesis of gamma activity in rodents visual cortex. I am combining data analysis with computational simulations to investigate the proprieties of gamma oscillations in the primary visual cortex in physiological and pathological conditions. My goal is to test and explore the potentialities of gamma activity as a biomarker of neural (mal)functioning.
        Data analysis, statistics, machine learning, programming, and computational simulations. Data on humans, mice, leech, and zebrafishes. I have (and hopefully will) experienced a plethora of tools and scientific journeys just to trying pushing forward the current knowledge of information processing of the central nervous system of a
